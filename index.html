      <img src="assets/images/Head-shot-long-hair.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>First off, I might be the most computer illiterate person to ever make an attempt at learning computer code. I have spent the bulk of my post-education time as an adult staying away from computers and spending my time outdoors. That however, has not deterred me from taking on this endeavor that I have developed a true enjoyment for.</p>

      <p> I have many interests in life, some of which I prioritize more than others. First and foremost, I love spending time with my kids and teaching them to be real, functional members of society.</p>

      <p> My biggest passion, and the thing I spend the most of my time with, including some of my time with my kids, is practicing martial arts. I have spent countless hours trying to hone my skills while improving my physical and mental abilities. I hope to use this same discipline to hone my coding and computer skills. The rest of my time is generally spent hiking, playing disc golf, playing the violin, or enjoying one of Colorado's fine breweries.
